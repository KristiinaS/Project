The Vigenère cipher was invented by a Frenchman, Blaise de Vigenère in the 16th century. It is a simple form of polyalphabetic cipher which uses a series of different Caesar ciphers to encrypt the data based on the letters of a keyword. Blaise de Vigenère developed a square to help encode messages (see below - Vigenére Table). A different row of the square can be used to encrypt each letter of the message. In other words, the sender might encrypt the first letter according to row 5, the second according to row 14, and the third letter according to row 21, and so on. In order to unscramble the message, it is important that the intended receiver knows which row of the Vigenère Square has been used to encipher each letter, and so there must be an agreed system of switching between rows. This agreement is achieved via the keyword.

To illustrate how the keyword is used, let's encipher a word MOTHER with keyword KEY. First, the keyword is spelt out above the message and repeated until each letter in the message is associated with a letter from the keyword. Above first letter of the message, M, is the key letter, K. To encrypt this first letter, we go to the column headed by M and then see where it intersects the row starting with K, which is at the letter W. Consequently, the letter M in the plaintext is represented by W in the ciphertext. This step is continued until the whole text has been enciphered. In this case the enciphered text would be WSRRIP.
