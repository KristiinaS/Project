The Atbash Cipher was originally a monoalphabetic substitution cipher used for the Hebrew alphabet. It is one of the earliest known subtitution ciphers to have been used, and is very simple.

The Atbash Cipher simply reverses the plaintext alphabet to create the ciphertext alphabet. That is, the first letter of the alphabet is encrypted to the last letter of the alphabet, the second letter to the second last letter and so forth.
