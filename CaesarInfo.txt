The Caesar cipher is one of the earliest known and simplest ciphers. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who apparently used it to communicate with his generals.

It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on.

In order to reverse the encrypted text, you need to use the opposite value of the shift. For example, if the original shift is 2, you can encode the text with shift -2.
